# **OCP 4.9 Installation Experience on bare metal using Assisted Installer APIs and Postman Client**

## **Pre-requisites**

Certain pre-requisites that have to be met before proceeding with this venture are included in the following:-

* Users have to establish an account in [Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Platform](https://console.redhat.com/) before trying the cloud based Assisted Installer for OCP (be it either the GUI or APIs).

* Next, users must obtain access to the OpenShift Cluster Manager API token which can be obtained through the [platform console UI](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token) or by using the [OpenShift Cluster Manager command-line tool](https://access.redhat.com/articles/6114701) `ocm-cli` and entering the command - `ocm token`.

>Note:- [Github repo and guide for ocm-cli](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli)

* Users must obtain access to the pull secret associated with acquiring images which can be obtained through the [platform console UI](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) as well.

* Users will have to obtain a set of machines/nodes that are to be part of the OCP cluster as master/worker nodes and a jump host which has direct access to them. Next, a public-private key pair for SSH must be generated in the host of choice that can access all the nodes and save the public key for AI API installation purposes.

* The Assisted Installer API [github repository](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service) can be referred along with the [base URL](https://api.openshift.com/api/assisted-install/v2/) or API endpoint for all the APIs.

* The Postman API platform or any other API client can be installed to examine the AI APIs from the swagger spec. Using Postman, the user can export the [swagger specification for the AI APIs](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-service/blob/master/swagger.yaml)  and create a collection of these API requests. Later, they can be modified to serve the user’s objectives. Else, the user can individually pick specific API requests from the swagger spec (formatting the spec for easier visibility using the Swagger Editor might be a good option) and then create a new collection within a new workspace to work on.

## **Steps**

The following steps are specific to using Postman as the API client.

### **Step 1**
The user can set environment variables which will be used when API requests are done by setting them in Postman by creating a new environment for the AI APIs.

>![Postman env for AI APIs](/Reference_Images/env-variables-postman.png "Environment variables for AI APIs set on Postman")

Environment variables for the pull secret, ocm token and ssh public key can have values that the user obtained as part of the pre-requisites.

### **Step 2**
A list of API requests relevant to installing OCP 4.9 can be found in the collection.json file in the [CP4NA repository](https://github.com/redhat-eets/cp4na/blob/main/assisted_installer_apis/AssistedInstaller_APIs.postman_collection.json). If this is imported into Postman from the mentioned file, it can be viewed like the following screenshot.

>![Postman AI APIs collection](/Reference_Images/Postman-APIs.png "Postman AI APIs collection")

The above API requests can also be manually added to the collection for execution by getting the request URLs and relevant environment variables obtained in the steps that follow.
Authorization has to be from the API token for all the API requests by setting the authorization type to API key and then setting the value to the API token stored as the environment variable earlier.

### **Step 3**
Use the [Create Cluster Definition Request](#create-cluster-definition-request) to start creating the OCP cluster. This will create the initial framework of the cluster along with needed information. Once the cluster definition is ready from the previous step, the user can verify if the cluster has come up by trying out the [List Cluster Request](#list-cluster-request) and seeing if the response has the intended cluster definition.

### **Step 4**
Next, the user can create a discovery ISO/infra-env for the cluster definition that was created earlier as part of Step 3 to boot up machines/nodes to be associated with the cluster. This can be done by executing the [Create Infrastructure Environment Request](#create-infrastructure-environment-request)(Get Discovery ISO). The user can then verify if the infra-env was created by executing the [List Infrastructure Environment Request](#list-infrastructure-environment-request) and seeing if the response has the infra-env.

### **Step 5**
Next, the user can get the download URL to the discovery ISO that was created in the previous step by executing the [Get Discovery Image Download URL Request](#get-discovery-image-download-url-request). The response will contain the URL which can be directly accessed in a browser to download the ISO image or it can be done by using the wget command.

### **Step 6**
The discovery ISO that was obtained earlier can be now used to boot hosts that are to be a part of the cluster. To see the status of the hosts that get discovered after booting with the ISO, the user can run the [Get Hosts Request](#get-hosts-request) and check the response. If hosts do not turn up in the response, they are either not discovered yet or the booting with the ISO did not succeed. 

### **Step 7**
Now that the hosts have been discovered, the user can proceed to start and complete OCP cluster installation by running the [Install Cluster Request](#install-cluster-request). Users can check the status of the installation and what’s happening behind the scenes by periodically checking the response of the [Get Cluster Events Request](#get-cluster-events-request).


### **Step 8**
The user can retrieve cluster admin credentials by running the [Get Cluster Credentials Request](#get-cluster-credentials-request). Additionally, users can also get credentials like the cluster kubeconfig by running the [Download Cluster Credentials Request](#download-cluster-credentials-request) and checking the response.

## **Installation Notes**
The cluster installation can be done using the Assisted Installer APIs by following the above steps or running the appropriate requests in the correct sequence. Using any API client software platform, requests can be sent to the AI API base URL endpoint.

Users can make use of the Swagger Editor online to visualize all the AI APIs by importing the swagger spec in the [editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

The following requests are the primary AI API requests used for the OCP cluster’s installation. Users can probe the request URL, plug in path values or query parameters and provide a request body to get intended request responses.
